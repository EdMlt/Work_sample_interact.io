To create a small version of the Leadscore.io platform, I created a little server with Node.js
So you can run it on you terminal usin the command "node server.js"
Then the login page is runnning on "localhost:8080/Login.html"

When you log the server to a request to interact.io API and display it on "localhost:8080/contact_list.html"
